## What Works:

*   Initialized the memory bank.
*   Created the project brief, product context, active context, system patterns, and tech context files.
*   Implemented semantic search using the OpenRouter API and the `liquid/lfm-7b` model.
*   Replaced `FlexSearch` with `minisearch` for local indexing and search.
*   Implemented category extraction using the `compromise` library.
*   Modified the `generateRecommendations` function to use `minisearch` for initial filtering.
*   Modified the `getKeywordsFromAI` function to only send relevant solutions to the OpenRouter API.
*   Added a stop word filter to the `extractCategories` function.
*   Customized the scoring function in `minisearch` to prioritize different fields.
*   Improved the filtering logic after the AI call to prevent correct solutions from being filtered out.
*   Added extensive logging for debugging and verification.
*   Created a `README.md` file to document the project.
*   Added pricing information to each SaaS solution in `data.js`.
*   Added a category field to each SaaS solution in `data.js`.
*   Implemented a table to display all SaaS solutions, categorized by their category, with their name and pricing.
*   Improved the UI of the table with consistent styling and responsiveness.

## What's Left to Build:

*   Explore caching strategies to further improve loading times.
*   Consider adding a search function to the table.
*   Consider implementing a database with pre-computed embeddings for improved scalability and performance.

## Current Status:

*   Semantic search enhanced with local NLP and search libraries.

## Known Issues:

*   None at this time.
