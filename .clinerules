## Project Intelligence

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively with this project.

### Key Insights

*   The project uses the OpenRouter API for natural language processing.
*   The project uses a manually curated list of SaaS solutions for recommendations.
*   The project is structured as a client-server application with a Node.js server and a HTML/CSS/JavaScript client.

### Tool Usage Patterns

*   The `replace_in_file` tool has been used extensively to modify the `server.js` and `public/index.html` files.
*   The `write_to_file` tool has been used to create new files such as `data.js` and `.env`.
*   The `execute_command` tool has been used to run commands such as `npm install` and `node server.js`.

*   The project uses a manually curated list of SaaS solutions for recommendations.
*   The project is structured as a client-server application with a Node.js server and a HTML/CSS/JavaScript client.
*   The project now uses `minisearch` for local indexing and search, improving scalability and performance.
*   The `generateRecommendations` function uses a customized scoring function to prioritize different fields in the `minisearch` results.

### Tool Usage Patterns

*   The `replace_in_file` tool has been used extensively to modify the `server.js` and `index.html` files.
*   The `write_to_file` tool has been used to create new files such as `data.js` and `.env`.
*   The `execute_command` tool has been used to run commands such as `npm install` and `node server.js`.
*   The `npm uninstall` tool has been used to remove unused dependencies.

### Challenges

*   Integrating external APIs can be challenging due to dependency issues and authentication requirements.
*   Maintaining consistency between the client and server code requires careful coordination.
*   Correctly configuring and using local search libraries like `minisearch` can be challenging due to their specific API and configuration options.
